# Homelab Infrastructure Improvements Roadmap

This document outlines recommended improvements for making the homelab infrastructure more secure, reliable, and production-ready.

## üìä 1. Enhanced Observability

### Loki for Logs (Priority: High)
**Status:** Configuration created at `gitops/infrastructure/loki.yaml`

**Features:**
- Centralized log aggregation
- Integration with Grafana
- Log correlation with metrics
- 7-day retention by default

**Implementation:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f gitops/infrastructure/loki.yaml
```

### Additional Prometheus Targets (Priority: High)
**Status:** Created at `infrastructure/monitoring/kube-prometheus-stack/manifests/base/additional-scrape-configs.yaml`

**Monitors:**
- ArgoCD metrics
- cert-manager metrics
- Sealed Secrets metrics
- Blackbox exporter for endpoint monitoring

## üíæ 2. Backup & Disaster Recovery

### Velero (Priority: High)
**Status:** Configuration created at `gitops/infrastructure/velero.yaml`

**Features:**
- Automated daily backups
- 30-day retention
- Disaster recovery capability
- Namespace or cluster-level backups

**Implementation:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f gitops/infrastructure/velero.yaml
```

## üîß 3. Developer Experience

### Makefile (Priority: High)
**Status:** Created at project root

**Commands:**
- `make install` - Complete installation
- `make status` - Check infrastructure
- `make test-ingress` - Test all endpoints
- `make backup` - Create backups

### CI/CD Integration (Priority: Medium)
**Status:** GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/validate.yaml`

**Features:**
- YAML validation
- Kubernetes manifest validation
- Security scanning with Trivy
- ArgoCD diff on PRs

## üåç 4. Multi-Environment Support

### Kustomize Overlays (Priority: Medium)
**Status:** Documentation at `infrastructure/docs/ENVIRONMENTS.md`

**Enables:**
- Dev/Staging/Prod environments
- Environment-specific configurations
- Safe testing before production
- GitOps for all environments

## üîê 5. Certificate Management

### cert-manager (Priority: Medium)
**Status:** Configuration created at `gitops/infrastructure/cert-manager.yaml`

**Advantages over Traefik's built-in:**
- More certificate types (not just Let's Encrypt)
- Better lifecycle management
- Certificate rotation automation
- Wildcard certificate support
- DNS-01 challenge support

## üöÄ 6. Additional Features

### Service Mesh (Priority: Low)
Consider Istio or Linkerd for:
- mTLS between services
- Advanced traffic management
- Circuit breaking
- Canary deployments

### GitOps Image Updates (Priority: Low)
**ArgoCD Image Updater** for:
- Automatic container updates
- Security patch automation
- Version pinning policies

### Infrastructure as Code (Priority: Medium)
**Crossplane** for:
- Cloud resource management
- Database provisioning
- Unified control plane

## üîí 7. Security Enhancements

### Sealed Secrets (Priority: Low)
**Status:** Configuration created at `gitops/infrastructure/sealed-secrets.yaml`

- Encrypts secrets in Git repositories
- Prevents exposing passwords in plain text
- Only the cluster can decrypt

**Implementation:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f gitops/infrastructure/sealed-secrets.yaml
```

### Network Policies (Priority: Low)
**Status:** Basic policies created at `infrastructure/security/network-policies/`

- Zero-trust network security
- Default deny all traffic
- Explicit allow rules only

**Benefits:**
- Prevents lateral movement in case of compromise
- Isolates workloads
- Compliance ready

### Resource Quotas (Priority: Low)
**Status:** Templates created at `infrastructure/security/resource-quotas/`

- Prevents resource exhaustion
- Fair resource distribution
- Cost control in cloud environments

### Policy Enforcement (Priority: Low)
**OPA Gatekeeper** for:
- Enforce security policies
- Compliance requirements
- Resource naming conventions
- Required labels/annotations

### Runtime Security (Priority: Low)
**Falco** for:
- Detect anomalous behavior
- Runtime threat detection
- Compliance monitoring
- Incident response
